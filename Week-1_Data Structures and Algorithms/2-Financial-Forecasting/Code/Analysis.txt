Analysis of Recursive Financial Forecasting Algorithm
1. Time Complexity Analysis:

The recursive algorithm (futureValueRecursive) has a time complexity of O(n), where n represents the number of periods.

With each recursive call reducing the period count by one until it reaches zero, the algorithm makes a total of n recursive calls.

2. Optimization Discussion:

While recursion works well for small values of n, it becomes impractical for large n due to the risk of stack overflow from too many recursive calls.

An iterative solution is better suited for large n, as it eliminates the overhead associated with recursion and stack usage.

Example of an iterative approach:
double futureValueIterative(double initialValue, double growthRate, int periods) {
    double value = initialValue;
    for (int i = 0; i < periods; i++) {
        value *= (1 + growthRate);
    }
    return value;
}

Memoization isnâ€™t required since each computation is performed only once, with no repeated subproblems.

3. Summary:

Recursion offers a simple and clear solution for this problem, but for larger input sizes, an iterative approach is more efficient and safer.
